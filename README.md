# **Musical Acoustics HOMEWORKS**

Homeworks developed for the course of Musical Acoustics 
<<<<<<< HEAD
- **HW1**: The first homework is about the study of [Helmotz Resonators and system impedance](./HW1/Musical_Acoustics_HW1.pdf). 
- **HW2**: The second homework is about the study of [Circular membrane and plate](./DAAP_HW2/DAAP_HW2_2023.pdf). Moreover the interaction between coupled acoustical systems is considered.
- **HW3**: The third homework is about the development of a [Leslie simulation](./SSSP_HW3/HW3.pdf) exploiting the fractional delay technique. The simple effect is developed in a real-time fashion in order to simulate a real case-study.

- **HW1**: The first homework is about the study of [Helmotz Resonators ](./) through LPC-based cross-synthesis. 
- The second homework is about the study of [Space-time-based source separation](./DAAP_HW2/DAAP_HW2_2023.pdf) technique for a two sensors linear microphone array. 
- The third homework is about the development of a [Leslie simulation](./SSSP_HW3/HW3.pdf) exploiting the fractional delay technique. The simple effect is developed in a real-time fashion in order to simulate a real case-study.

  The [report](./SSSP_HW3/Doimo_Ostan_HW3/SASP_HW3.pdf) reguarding the development techniques employed is included. 
- The fourth homework is about the development of a [three way crossover](./SSSP_HW4/HW4/HW4.pdf) in order to study the theory and implementation involved with wave digital filters.
