# **Musical Acoustics HOMEWORKS**

Homeworks developed for the course of Musical Acoustics 

- **HW1**: The first homework is about the study of [Helmoltz Resonators](./HW1/Musical_Acoustics_HW1.pdf). The study comprehend design specifications, system resonant frequency and impedance.
- **HW2**: The second homework is about the study of [Circular membrane and plate](./DAAP_HW2/DAAP_HW2_2023.pdf). Moreover the interaction between coupled acoustical systems is considered.
- **HW3**: The third homework is about the design of [Horn](./HW3/MusAc-Ostan_Don%C3%A0-HW3.pdf). The study includes shape optimization, error evaluation, impedance evaluation and inharmonicity evaluation.
- **HW4**: The fourth homework is about the design of a [piano](./HW4/Musical_Acoustics_HW4_OstanDon%C3%A0.pdf). During development a simulation on soundboard characterization was made, comprehensive of COMSOL finite element simulations, comparing different materials. Then the design of the bridge is performed, taking into account an optimized placement compared with bibliography case-studies. The pairing of the strings and the eigenfrequencies are then considered and evaluated deeply. 
- **HW5**: The fifth homework is about the design of a [recorder flute](./HW5/Musical_Acoustics_HW5_OstanDon%C3%A0.pdf). Various parameters are studied during the design. The cone diameter for the resonator, the holes positions, the thickness of the flute channel and of the boundary layer.
- **HL1**: The first homelab finite-elements modelling with COMSOL multiphysics. The specific case-study is the modelling of a [glass](./HL1/Consegna%202/Musical_Acoustics_HL1_Don%C3%A0Ostan.pdf). In the specific the study deals with the comparison between standard modelling and axisymmetrical modelling.
- **HL2**: The second homelab is about the study of [Helmoltz resonator trees](./HL2/Don%C3%A0Ostan_HL2_Deliver/Don%C3%A0Ostan_HL2.pdf).
The model is made exploiting Electromechanoacoustical circuit equivalents. The impedance and admittance are then studied varying tree construction parameters. 
- **HL3**: The third homelab is about the study of [acoustical modeling techniques](./HL3/Delivery/Musical_Acoustics_HL3_Ostan_Don%C3%A0.pdf). In the specific finite difference modeling and electromechanoacoustical equivalents for complex mechanical elements are considered.
- **HL4**: The fourth homelab is about the study of [brass instrument simulation](./HL4/Consegna_HL4_OstanDon%C3%A0%202/Musical_Acoustics_HL4-2.pdf). The study considers a COMSOL acoustic simulation of a trumpet.
