% NOTES:
% in this file we didn't use the functions myFFT() and 
% plotFFT_linearFreqScale() because we noticed that the fft returned by the
% first function wasn't smooth enough in order to collect qualitative and
% quantitave informations from it. Instead, the built-in fft of MATLAB gave
% us the smoothness we needed. Moreover, given the high differences in
% terms of order of magnintude of the different peaks we built our own
% function FRF_Plot that is an easier modification of the second given
% function, and it plots the magnitude in dB scale in order to understand
% better the behavior of the system.
